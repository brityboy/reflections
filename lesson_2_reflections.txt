What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized, a .git file is made to keep track of all the version changes throughout the repository's history.
This needs to be done to track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is different from the working directory because the working directory is the path that contains all files
while the staging area only contains the files that are to be tracked. the values are different because working directory
shows the entire path while the staging area shows both the tracked files and the working directory
